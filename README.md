# bme-fon-auralex

**bme-fon-auralex** is a learning-focused project within the **Before Month’s End – Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project follows a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project begins on the **first day of the month** and concludes on the **last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project runs from:

**📅 January 1, 2026 → January 31, 2026**

## Project Intent

This repository serves as a space to explore and practice solving coding problems across different platforms and programming languages. The emphasis is on experimentation, comparison, and repetition rather than producing a single polished solution.

Problems may come from sites such as LeetCode or similar coding challenge platforms, and solutions may vary in completeness or style as part of the learning process.

## Areas of Exploration

This project explores coding challenges and problem-solving patterns across multiple platforms and programming languages.

Areas of exploration include, but are not limited to:

* Solving coding challenges from platforms such as **LeetCode** and similar problem sets
* Implementing the same problem across **multiple programming languages** to compare syntax, expressiveness, and approach
* Observing differences in:
  * Readability
  * Performance characteristics
  * Language-specific strengths and limitations
* Identifying recurring problem-solving patterns that translate well between languages

As a potential later extension, this exploration may inform the creation of a separate **speed-testing project** focused on comparing the runtime performance of different language implementations for the same problems.

Whether this remains part of AuraleX or becomes its own project will depend on scope, complexity, and findings during the exploration.

The depth and breadth of exploration may vary throughout the project window, with some languages, comparisons, or extensions receiving more focus than others depending on time and findings.

## Scope & Flexibility

This project is intentionally open-ended.
Languages, platforms, and structure may change as the project progresses.

Incomplete solutions, alternative approaches, and exploratory code are expected and accepted as part of the learning process.

---

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project follows the **Finished Or Not** approach:

* Time-boxed learning
* Progress over perfection
* Iteration over abandonment

The repository reflects learning in motion rather than a finalized product.
