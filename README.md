# bme-fon-auralex

**bme-fon-auralex** is a learning-focused project within the **Before Month’s End – Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project follows a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project begins on the **first day of the month** and concludes on the **last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project runs from:

**📅 January 1, 2026 → January 31, 2026**

## Project Intent

This repository serves as a space to explore and practice solving coding problems across different platforms and programming languages. The emphasis is on experimentation, comparison, and repetition rather than producing a single polished solution.

Problems may come from sites such as LeetCode or similar coding challenge platforms, and solutions may vary in completeness or style as part of the learning process.

## Scope & Flexibility

This project is intentionally open-ended.
Languages, platforms, and structure may change as the project progresses.

Incomplete solutions, alternative approaches, and exploratory code are expected and accepted as part of the learning process.

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project follows the **Finished Or Not** approach:

* Time-boxed learning
* Progress over perfection
* Iteration over abandonment

The repository reflects learning in motion rather than a finalized product.
