## Completions
- Completed second section of Math Quests

## Next Focus
- LeetCode Quests
    - Complete second section quiz of Math Quests
    - Consider looking into first section of Database Quests

## Notes
- Notes added in LeetCode/Quests/Maths/Q2_Divisibility&ModularArithmetic folder.
- Looking up a hint of the second question helped even after thinking about it more each time.
- Thinking back the solution is obvious, but annoying that it wasn't a first solution.
