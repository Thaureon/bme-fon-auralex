## Completions
- Finished the 2nd section of the System & Software Design Quests excluding the Quiz

## Next Focus
- LeetCode Quests
    - Setup the final pieces of the BME to represent the end of this project.

## Notes
- Notes added in LeetCode/Quests folder for each completion.
- While this solution did use some of the built in features of C#, there are some pieces that I have not used before.
- Learning how other features works just for a single problem is a good way of approaching things, but not the best when trying to get it to work.
