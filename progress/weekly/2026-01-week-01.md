# Week 1 - January 2026
📅 January 1 - January 3, 2026

## Summary
The first week focused on project setup and beginning LeetCode problems with Problem 9. 
Time was primarily spent establishing repository and folder structure for sultions of LeetCode Problems, and defining the progress tracking system.

Problem 9 was solved with multiple different languages to understand how each one would be created differently.

## What Worked
- Setting up a consistent project and progress structure early
- Defining clear expectations for daily vs weekly logging
- Trying to write the problem in multiple languages, each langauge had various differences from subtle to significant.

## What Didn't
- Choosing C# first for solutions does not help much when learning new languages.  This was just copying and adjusting the solution into that language

## Next Week
- Continue development on other problems
